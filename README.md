# L30Gamma
A Discord bot that does a few relatively simple tasks (for now!)

The bot operated by way of a token, which is hidden in a .env file so that only I can upload code to the bot. 
When the bot is on a Discord server, you can communicate with it by entering "g." followed by a command.
The current list of working commands can be seen by entering "g.help", but the list is growing as I continue working on new functions.
At the moment, commands are case insensitive and separated by a single spacebar (though some commands may also work with multiple spaces).

For now, I don't have a dedicated server to hold the bot, so it can only ever be online when I run the bot.js file.
